# PCOS-detection

Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a widespread endocrine disorder affecting women globally. 
* This project leveraged the power of computational algorithms trained on patient data for model prediction where the Decision tree with criterion Gini index outperformed with 88.07% accuracy, 85.29% precision, 78.37% recall and 81.69% F1 Score.
* Bagging and boosting algorithms were used to monitor their performance metrics where Gradient Boost stood out with a remarkable accuracy of 91.74%, 91.00% precision, 97.00% recall and 94.00% F1 Score.
* By optimizing the chosen parameters through Hyperparameter tuning, a notable increase in the modelâ€™s accuracy was observed.
* Three ensemble models were proposed out of which the ensemble classifier ensemble model involving bagging, boosting and single classifiers brought a significant difference of 95.41% accuracy.
* Explainable (XAI) methodologies like LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations) and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) were employed for model interpretability.
